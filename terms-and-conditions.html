<p><strong>POMELO SOLUTIONS, LLC</strong><br /><em>(FitMeNow.com)</em><br />
Terms and Conditions<br />
Updated: September 14, 2017</p>

<p>Pomelo Solutions, LLC (“Pomelo”) provides mobile business software (the “Platforms”) for appointment based business professionals (the “Service Providers”) for various service oriented industries, including FitMeNow.com. These Terms and Conditions will apply to all Pomelo Platforms. The use of Pomelo’s Website and mobile application (the “Application”) and/or the Services, constitutes a contract with Pomelo, with respect to use of any Website, Application and/or Services. By using a Pomelo Website, Application and Services, a Service Provider agrees to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”), as well as Pomelo’s separate Privacy Policy; whether or not a Service Provider becomes a registered user of the Services.</p>

<p>Pomelo provides Service Providers with software tools for managing information about their business, their clients, scheduling and tracking client reservations, client communications, and billing and payment processing through Stripe (the “Services”). These Terms govern access to and use of each Platform Website, Application and Services; and any participation in any Pomelo Platform constitutes a binding legal agreement between the Service Provider and Pomelo.

<p>1. MODIFICATION. Pomelo reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Platform Websites, Applications and/or Services and to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If Pomelo modifies these Terms, Pomelo will post such modification on the applicable Platform Website and Application. Pomelo will also update the “Last Updated Date” at the top of the then current Terms.

<p>2. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION. In order to access certain features of each Platform Website and Application, and to book a reservation, Service Providers must register to create an account directly, via such Website and/ or Application.</p>

<p>Pomelo will create a Service Provider’s account and account profile page for use of the Website or the Application based upon the personal information provided to Pomelo. Each Service Provider shall provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Service Providers are responsible for safeguarding passwords and are solely responsible for any activities or actions under such account.</p>

<p>3. DISCLOSURES AND WARRANTIES / RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTENT. All information (including alerts, profiles and schedules) is based upon information provided to Pomelo. Service Providers shall be solely responsible for all content made available through the Website, the Application and the Services by the Service Provider, including Client information. Pomelo shall not be responsible for undertaking any independent investigation. Service Providers are required to provide accurate information, and although Pomelo may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, Pomelo does not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Service Provider or any Service Provider’s purported identity or background. By using Pomelo’s Websites, Applications or Services, Service Providers agree that any legal remedy or liability available to Service Provider, for actions or omissions of other users or other third parties, will be limited to a claim against the particular users or other third parties who caused such harm. Service Providers agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Pomelo with respect to such actions or omissions.</p>

<p>Pomelo reserves the right to remove or ban any Service Provider from Pomelo’s Websites and Applications, for any reason.</p>

<p>4. DEFINITIONS.</p>

<p>4.1. “Consumers” or “Clients” are those individuals who, through the use of Pomelo’s Platforms, transact business with a Service Provider.</p>

<p>4.2. Pomelo and Service Provider may be referred to as a "Party" or collectively as the "Parties" as appropriate.</p>

<p>4.3. Any program, class or appointment provided by a Service Provider, through a Pomelo Platform Website or Application, may be referred to as a “Reservation”.</p>

<p>5. PAYMENT PROCESSING.</p>

<p>5.1. Service Providers have the option of accepting payments by cash, check, or credit card from Consumers.</p>

<p>5.2. Pomelo will create a Stripe account on behalf of the Service Provider, which the Service Provider must activate. Once established, the Service Provider shall be solely responsible for the account. All Service Providers are responsible for reviewing Stripe’s Terms of Service, which are separate and distinct from these Terms and Conditions. All Service Providers are responsible for being familiar with and abiding by such Terms of Service, which control Service Provider’s use of the Stripe Services. Service Provider shall be responsible for all charges and fees incurred by Service Provider (or their Clients).</p>

<p>5.3. Credit card payments from Consumers are deposited to the Service Provider’s Stripe account, after payment of a credit card processing fee. The Service Providers are solely responsible for configuring Payout options for their Stripe account.</p>

<p>5.5. Stripe’s contact information and Terms of Service are published and maintained by Stripe and made available on their website (https://stripe.com).</p>

<p>6. SUBSCRIPTION FEES / POMELO</p>

<p>6.1. Pomelo uses Stripe for credit card payment processing of costs and fees payable to Pomelo.</p>

<p>6.2. Payments for Pomelo’s services are separate from any fees or charges by Stripe, for transactions between a Service Provider and any Consumer.</p>

<p>6.3. Pomelo does not retain credit card information, other than the last 4 digits.</p>

<p>6.4. By enrolling in Pomelo’s monthly membership program, Service Provider agrees to pay and authorize Pomelo to automatically charge their credit card each month for the agreed monthly membership fee until the Service Provider pauses or cancels the subscription. Membership charges are non-refundable, and Service Provider is responsible for changing or updating their credit card information in the Application. Declined charges may result in suspension of the Service Provider’s account until membership fees are brought up to date. Accounts that are suspended for six months may be cancelled, resulting in deletion of all information associated with the account.</p>

<p>6.5. Service Provider may cancel their subscription at any time. Any cancellation request may require at least 48 hours before becoming effective following our receipt of the request, and it will take effect at the end of the current subscription period from the time of processing the request.

<p>6.6. Pomelo reserves the right to change the Subscription Fees upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice. Continued use of the Application after notice of a change to the Subscription Fee will constitute Service Provider’s agreement to such changes.</p>

<p>6.7. Services Providers retain all rights to the information they provide about the Service Provider and their Customers, but Pomelo retains all rights and ownership of all Platforms, Software, Services and Applications, including our right to suspend access to their information if subscription payments are delinquent, and delete the data if: (a) they terminate their subscription; or (b) their account is suspended for six (6) months.</p>

<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. SERVICE PROVIDERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE WEBSITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES, LISTING OR BOOKING OF ANY RESERVATIONS VIA THE WEBSITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES, AND ANY CONTACT SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE WITH CONSUMERS WHETHER IN PERSON OR ONLINE REMAINS WITH PROFESSIONAL.
